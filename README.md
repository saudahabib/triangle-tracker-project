# Triangle Tracker Project
#### This is a webpage that takes three values from a user and works on them to determine if they make up a triangle and what type of triangle it is. {15/02/2019}
#### By {Sauda Habib Salim
### Description
The website has three boxes in which the user enters numerical values. Upon submitting, the webpage determines what type of triangle the value makes up, if a triangle at all. It also provides a platform for people interested in performing other calculations to work from. The user can access educational videos on geometrical shapes other than triangles too.
